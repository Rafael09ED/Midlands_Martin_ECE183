Lab 7: Delimiter matching
Instructions

Write a Java application to
    open any text file,
    then to read the entire file character by character and
        use a stack of characters to either
            output an error message
                if parens, brackets and curly braces are not properly nested, or
            a message stating that the file is correct if all of those symbols are properly nested.
    The basic idea is to
        push left parens, left brackets and left curly braces onto the stack, then to
        pop the stack when a right paren, right bracket or right curly brace is encountered and
            make sure the two symbols match.

Be sure to output
    appropriate, different, error messages
        if the left symbol from the stack does not match the right one,
        if the stack is empty when you need to pop it, and
        if the stack is not empty when the input is complete.

Note that a Java program that compiles will be correct if there are no parens, brackets or braces in quotes or comments.
